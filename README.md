<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository will include a variety of bash scripts. 

- Menu based scripts to improve work flow and support.
- System scripts for gathering instance data.
- Project scripts specific to project tasks.
- General scripts and templates.
- **Terraform** and **Ansible** scripting. 

The main technology 'stack' will be **Bash-awk-whiptail.** 
Interactive, menu based scripts can be useful when there are a lot of projects with varying degrees of complexity. 

Menu based scripts can also support junior and intermediate level linux admins when implementing complex tasks, e.g. on-premise TLS server certification creation.
